        <h1>YAY! haha this was fun </h1>
        <p>hi k money totes not a birthday note or anything but you were born today 18 years ago so like very cutie day in my opinion just wanted to say that May Allah keep on blessing you with even greater blessings than you imagine, may he keep u happy and always smiling yarab u truly deserve it. also wanted to point out that i’m sososoos grateful for u and i love you with my whole heart even when ur being a hugely rude man i love everything about u and appreciate you till infinity . everytime i see you my heart calms down and i feel at peace which is wild because i’ve known you for more than a year now and i still for some odd reason get nervous when i speak to you. you’ve helped me become more mature, more understanding, and a better person in so many more unexplainable ways and not to be narcissistic or nothing but i think you’re my blessed angel i could never be more thankful for you than today. truly i think you’re an amazing human with an amazing mindset and amazing humour honestly you’re just amazing overall. i love your pure heart and how you’re so smart so pretty (handsome or whatever u men like) and how نيتك بيضاء, you’re my perfect man . u may think i am being overly nice here but i could hate you (God forbid) and still mean everything i said you’re astronomically amazing and barakAllah you’re still young and striving u have such a bright future ahead of you inshAllah and hopefully we’re still bestfrens so i could see and celebrate you at ur best. anywhosles thank you for everything words cannot express the love i have for you and your precious soul 
u old old man
